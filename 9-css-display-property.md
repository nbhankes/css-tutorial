## Understanding the Display Property Values

Below is a list of the most common display property values:

**block**: An element takes up its own space, meaning it covers the entire width of the page and neighboring elements are positioned to either side of the element
<br />
**inline**: An element does not generate line breaks before or after itself. In a normal layout, the next element will be on the same line if there is space
<br />
**inline-block**: Similar to inline, except that you're able to assign a height and width
<br />
**table**: An element behaves like the table html tag
<br />
**none**: An element is removed from the DOM without being deleted. Surrounding elements will fill in to the space of the element with the display property value of none. Often paired with Javascript to make element disappear and appear at the click of a button.  

These are just a few of the most common display property values that you will work with. For an exhaustive list, visit Mozilla Developer Network CSS display
