## Introduction
This tutorial provides the definition of the CSS property and provides various examples and resources to find out more.

## Prerequisites
A basic understanding of HTML

##Understanding CSS Properties
CSS properties define a design or functionality aspect that will apply to the HTML element defined by a CSS selector. Every CSS property has a list of predefined CSS property values that apply to it. In the following CSS syntax, the selector is used to define an HTML element to which the { property: property value } pair, or declaration, applies.  

```css
selector {
  property: property value;
}
```
In the below example, we have placed div in the selector position, meaning the { property: property value } pair, or declaration, that follow applies to all div elements within the linked HTML file. The CSS property here is "background," and its property value of "red" will change the design aspect of background to the color red. 

```css
div {
 background: red
}
```

In the above example, we've assigned a background color of red to all div elements within the linked HTML file. 

## Harnessing the Power of CSS Properties
CSS properties can change almost every design aspect you can imagine. You are only limited by your knowledge of what's possible, so it is important to familiarize yourself with the CSS properties available for your use.

These properties allow to change the HTML design in the following ways:
- Coloration
- Shape and size
- Font manipulation
- Orientation (left, centered, right, custom)
- Movement
- Spacing between HTML elements
- Opacity
- And countless other ways.
